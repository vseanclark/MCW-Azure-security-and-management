# Azure security and management hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will first deploy a simple web application and database to Azure IaaS VMs, using a Resource Manager Template and Azure Automation DSC. You will then configure a range of infrastructure management capabilities on this deployment, including Update Management, Security Center, Service Map, Change Tracking and Application Insights. You will use Azure Monitor to configure application alerts and send, via both email and mobile application notifications. You will also learn how to further investigate infrastructure status using Log Analytics queries. In doing so, you will learn both how to deploy these solutions and be introduced to their capabilities.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to design, implement and use a wide range of infrastructure management systems in Azure.

>**Note**: The setup tasks should be completed in advance of the hands-on lab to save deployment time.

## Overview

Contoso Holdings is a multi-national holding company headquartered in Los Angeles, CA that owns 48 manufacturing companies located in North America, Europe and Asia. These companies sell their products primarily to either distributors or large retail organizations around the world. Contoso, as the parent company, controls the IT systems for the companies that it owns and thus runs their e-commerce-based applications. There are about 125 of these e-commerce applications used primarily for business-to-business purchasing by corporate buyers. These apps provide the bulk of Contoso's 15 billion dollars in revenue per year, so they are mission critical.

Recently Contoso has started to investigate what it would take to move from on-premises datacenters to the cloud. Most of their applications are ASP.NET running on Windows VMs with SQL Server in a traditional N-tier configuration. Their goal is to lift and shift these applications over to the cloud while gaining more control over the applications and improving their security posture.

They are looking for you to build out a prototype system in Azure using a sample web application they have provided to you called CloudShop.

They are looking for management tools that will allow them to have a full end-to-end view of both the infrastructure and application performance. Their goal will be to effectively lift and shift all applications over to the cloud. They do not have time or money to instrument the applications. Of course, security is on the top of the chain, so they also need a security solution and updated management system.

Per Roberto Milian, VP of Development and IT Operations, "Contoso's primary concern is how to best: deploy, test, manage, monitor, patch, secure and troubleshoot these applications in Azure IaaS."

## Exercise 1: Configure Azure automation

Duration: 15 minutes

### Overview

In this exercise, you will create and configure an Azure Automation account in the Azure Portal which will be used to configure the application servers using Azure DSC.

### Task 1: Create automation account

1. Browse to the Azure Portal, and authenticate at <https://portal.azure.com/>.

2. Click **+Create a resource,** and type **Automation** in the search box. Choose **Automation** from the results.

    ![Fields in the Everything blade are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Lab-guide/image21.png "Everything blade")

3. Select **Create** on the Automation blade. This will display the **Add Automation Account** blade.

4. On the **Add Automation Account** blade, specify the following information:

    - Name: **Automation-Acct**

    - Resource group: **HOLRGAUTO** (create a new resource group)

    - Location: **East US 2** or **West Europe**

    >**Note**: Not all Azure Automation features are supported in all regions. We suggest using East US 2 or West Europe, whichever is closer to you.

    ![Fields in the Add Automation Account blade are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Lab-guide/image22.png "Add Automation Account blade")

5. Click **Create**.

### Task 2: Add an Azure Automation credential

1. The CloudShopSQL DSC configuration requires a credential object to access the local administrator account on the virtual machine. Within the newly created Azure Automation DSC configuration select **Credentials** in the **SHARED RESOURCES** section.

    ![Under Shared Resources, Credentials is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image24.png "Shared Resources section")

2. Select the **Add a credential** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Add a credential button.](images/Lab-guide/image25.png "Add a credential button")

3. Specify the following properties and click **Create** to continue:

    - Name: **SQLLocalAdmin**

    - User Name: **demouser**

    - Password & Confirm: **demo\@pass123**

    ![New Credential blade fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Lab-guide/image26.png "New Credential blade")

    >**Important**: It is important to use the exact name for the credential, because one of the scripts you upload in the next step references the name directly.

### Task 3: Upload DSC configurations into automation account

1. Select **Resource groups \> HOLRGAUTO \> Automation-Acct** and click **State Configurations (DSC) in Configuration Management** then select **configuration** then selet **Add**.

    ![Screenshot of the Automation Account blade.](images/Lab-guide/image27.png "Automation Account blade")

2. Select the **+ Add a configuration** button.

    ![In the Automation Account blade, the Add a configuration button is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image28.png "Automation Account blade")

3. On the **Import** pane, upload both **C:\\HOL\\CloudShopSQL.ps1** and **C:\\HOL\\CloudShopWeb.ps1** files. You'll need to select **+ Add a configuration** a second time to upload the second file.

    ![Screenshot of the Import blade with fields set to the previously defined settings.](images/Lab-guide/image29.png "Import blade")

4. After importing the .ps1 files, select the **CloudShopSQL** DSC Configuration. Then, select **Compile** on the toolbar (*click **Yes** on the overwrite prompt*). Do the same for **CloudShopWeb**.

    ![The name field is set to CloudShopSQL in the Automation Account blade.](images/Lab-guide/image30.png "Automation Account blade")

    ![Screenshot of the Configuration blade.](images/Lab-guide/image31.png "Configuration blade")

    ![In the Compile DSC Configuration box, the Yes button is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image32.png "Compile DSC Configuration box")

5. Make sure to review the DSC configurations to ensure they have completed the compile prior to moving on to the next step.

### Summary

In this exercise, you configured an Automation account, and configured DSC configuration scripts that will be leveraged by the virtual machine resources.

## Exercise 2: Build CloudShop environment

Duration: 60 minutes

### Overview

In this exercise, you will run a template deployment using an ARM template provided which will deploy a Virtual Network, Azure Load balancer, two IIS Servers and a SQL Server. The Servers will check into Azure Automation and run the DSC Configurations that you built in Exercise 1. This will configure the boxes with the CloudShop Application. You will also configure Inbound NAT Rules to allow RDP access to the Web Servers. Azure diagnostics will also be configured into a new storage account for the VMs.

### Task 1: Template deployment

1. In the portal, open your Azure Automation Account created earlier.

2. Under **Account Settings,** locate the and select **Keys**.

    ![Under Account Settings, Keys is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image34.png "Account Settings section")

3. Open ***Notepad*** and copy both the **Primary Access Key** and the **URL**. These will be needed inputs for the template deployment.

    ![The copy buttons are selected next to the Primary Access Key and URL.](images/Lab-guide/image35.png "Access keys")

    ![The primary key and URL displays in Notepad.](images/Lab-guide/image36.png "Notepad")

4. In the Azure Portal, select the **+Create a resource** button. In the Search box, type **Template Deployment.**

5. Select **Template Deployment and** click **Create** on the following screen.

    ![Template deployment is circled in the Everything blade.](images/Lab-guide/image37.png "Everything blade")

6. On the **Custom deployment** screen, select **Build your own template in the editor**.

### Summary

In this exercise, you ran a template deployment using an ARM template provided which created a Virtual Network, Azure Load balancer, two IIS Servers and a SQL Server. The servers checked into Azure Automation and ran the DSC Configurations that configured the boxes with the CloudShop Application. You then configured Inbound NAT Rules to allow RDP access to the Web Servers and successfully connected. Azure diagnostics was also configured into a new storage account for the VMs.

## Exercise 3: Build and configure Azure Security Center and Azure Management

Duration: 30 minutes

### Overview

The next step is to provision the Azure security and Azure management components of Azure Automation, configure the VMs for the CloudShop application to be managed by the portal, and configure the diagnostics storage account to load data into the Log Analytics platform. Additionally, you will configure Update Management, Inventory Tracking and Change Management as well as install and configure the Service Map solution pack.

### Task 1: Provision Log Analytics through Azure Monitor

1. Open the **Azure portal** and navigate to Azure Monitor by clicking **All services**, searching for "*Log Analytics*", and selecting **Monitor**.

    ![Under Operations, Update management is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image91.png "Operations section")

8. The Portal shows the Update Management dashboard for the virtual machine. Here you can see which updates are pending, and the overall update compliance status of the VM.

    ![Missing updates shows as zero.](images/Lab-guide/image94.png "Missing updates message")

9. Click on **Schedule update deployment**. The portal shows the 'New update deployment' blade, where you can choose which updates to deploy (based on classification), which to exclude (based on KnowledgeBase ID), when to deploy, and the duration of the maintenance window (updates not deployed within 20 minutes of the end of this time window are omitted so the VM can reboot.)

     ![The New Update Deployment blade shows the settings described in the preceeding text.](images/Lab-guide/image186.png "New update deployment")

    Review the update settings, but do *not* configure an update deployment (to save time during the lab). Close the New update deployment blade.

10. Select on **Manage multiple machines**. This brings you to the Update Management view within the Azure Automation portal experience. This gives you an overview of update compliance across all of your VMs.

     ![Screenshot of the Log Analytics Update Managemnent experience. The VMs we have created are listed, together with metrics showing the number of updates pending/failed.](images/Lab-guide/image188.png "Update Management experience")

11. Select **New update deployment** brings a similar update deployment blade, except in this case you can configure the update deployment to be either Windows or Linux (previously the OS was inferred from the VM), and select which VMs will be updated (previously the blade applied only to a single VM).

    ![The New Update Deployment blade shows the settings described in the preceeding text.](images/Lab-guide/image187.png "New update deployment")

    Updating VMs via this Log Analytics experience enables central management of updates.

Then, you configured Application Insights to perform web tests and alerts.

## Exercise 5: Explore Azure Security and Operations Management, Application Insights and build a dashboard

Duration: 45 minutes

### Overview

In this exercise, you will explore the information and data being provided by Azure Security and Operations Management and Application Insights to gain situational awareness of the application and infrastructure. You will look at the Security posture of the infrastructure, the applications performance, and build a dashboard that can be used to manage it moving forward.

### Task 1: Work with Log Analytics queries

In this section, we will perform an ad-hoc search in Log Analytics data to see where our servers are not in compliance with security baselines. In the Log Search interface, we can perform ad-hoc searches against the log data being ingested into the Log Analytics service. Because the data is indexed, searching is very fast.

1. Open the **Azure portal** and navigate to Azure Monitor by clicking on **All services**, searching for "*log analytics*", and selecting **Log Analytics**.

    ![Selections in the Azure Portal display as previously mentioned.](images/Lab-guide/image66.png "Azure Portal")

2. Select **Log** from the left under **General**.

    ![Under Shared Services, Log Analytics is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image141.png "Shared Services section")

3. In the query editor, enter the following query: *Update \| where OSType!=\"Linux\" and Optional==false*. Select Run. This will search the Update management logs and report results. There are many other data sources we can query.

    ![Screenshot of the Log Search blade.](images/Lab-guide/image142.png "Log Search blade")

    >**Note:** you may have less or more data, but keep in mind, the service has only been collecting data since you began the lab.

4. Notice in the left, there are different types of data. Select **Windows Defender** followed by **Apply**.

    ![Under product, both the Windows Defender checkbox and the Apply button are selected.](images/Lab-guide/image143.png "Product section")

5. Notice the query dialog (where you entered a search before) has a search string in it querying for the type "Product==Windows Defender".

    ![An updated search string displays in the Query dialog box.](images/Lab-guide/image144.png "Query dialog box")

6. As you click on options in Log Search, queries are built automatically. Also, notice the results are paired down to a smaller subset of data. Click on **Table** to view the data in a column and row format.

    ![A Table of search results displays.](images/Lab-guide/image145.png "Table")

7. This is a list of Windows virtual machines tracked in Update management that have pending updates for Windows Defender. To further refine the list, scroll on the left down to **UPDATESTATE** and select **Needed** (this option may not be shown if all updates are already installed). Notice the query automatically updates as it is a single point to refine.

    ![An updated search string displays in the Query dialog box. Below, in the Table, a callout points out that UpdateState for both table entries displays as Needed.](images/Lab-guide/image146.png "Qyery dialog box and Table")

8. Further refinements can be made as needed. Select additional refiners to update the search.

9. Next, sort the findings, so the Computers are sorted alphabetically. Click on the column header **Computer** until the virtual machines are sorted correctly.

    ![In the Table, on the header row, Computer is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image147.png "Table")

10. Now we will export the list. This may be helpful if we wanted to divide the findings list out amongst administrators, so several people can help remediate the findings. Click on **Export**.

    ![On the Log Search blade top menu, Export is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image148.png "Log Search blade top menu")

    ![The Exporting results to Excel message displays.](images/Lab-guide/image149.png "Exporting results message")

11. Once the report is exported, you are prompted what to do with the file. Select **Save**. Once completed, click on **Open**. Choose **Notepad** to open the file**.

   ![The first message asking if you want to save SearchResults.csv has the Save button selected. The second message, download has completed has the Open button selected. The third message asks how you want to open the file, and Notepad is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image150.png "Multiple messages")

12. Review the text file. Then, close it. You can also copy the file to your local PC and view in Excel.

    ![Screenshot of the .csv information displaying in a Microsoft Excel window.](images/Lab-guide/image151.png "Excel window")

13. Because this is a useful query, we can save it to be able to quickly run it again anytime we wish. First, copy the search query to the clipboard.

    ![Screenshot of a Search query with the Copy option selected.](images/Lab-guide/image152.png "Search query")

14. Click the **Saved Searches** followed by **+Add**.

    ![Saved Searches is selected from the Log Search blade top menu.](images/Lab-guide/image153.png "Log Search blade top menu")

15. Complete the Add Saved Search Blade with this information:

    - Display Name: **Computers Needing Windows Defender Updates**

    - Category: **My Queries**

    - Query: **Paste the query from your clipboard**.

    - Function Alias: **WindowsDefNeeded**

    ![Add Saved Search blade fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Lab-guide/image154.png "Add Saved Search blade")

16. Select **OK.**

17. Let's explore some more sample queries. These are taken from the repository at: <https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/LogAnalyticsExamples/tree/master/log-analytics>.

    Replace the current query with the following:
    ```
    let start_time=ago(23h);
    let end_time=now();
    Heartbeat
    | summarize heartbeat_per_hour=count() by bin_at(TimeGenerated, 1h, start_time), Computer
    | extend available_per_hour=iff(heartbeat_per_hour>0, true, false)
    | summarize total_available_hours=countif(available_per_hour==true) by Computer 
    | extend total_number_of_buckets=round((end_time-start_time)/1h)+1
    | extend availability_rate=total_available_hours*100/total_number_of_buckets
    ```
    Click **Run**.

18. Select **Table** output. Notice how this query calculates VM availability, based on heartbeats.

    ![Screenshot showing the preceeding query in Log Analytics, with a table showing the %age availability of each VM.](images/Lab-guide/image185.png "Log Search showing VM availability query")

    For more information on how this query works, see <https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/LogAnalyticsExamples/blob/master/log-analytics/server-availability-rate.md>.

19. Replace the current query with the following:
    ```
    // Find all processes that started in the last 3 days. ID 4688: A new process has been created.
    let RunProcesses = 
        SecurityEvent
        | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
        | where EventID == "4688";
    // Find the 5 processes that were run the most
    let Top5Processes =
        RunProcesses
        | summarize count() by Process
        | top 5 by count_;
    // Create a time chart of these 5 processes - hour by hour
    RunProcesses 
    | where Process in (Top5Processes) 
    | summarize count() by bin (TimeGenerated, 1h), Process
    | render timechart
    ```
    Click **Run**.

    This query uses security events (only available when using the Standard tier of Security Center) to identify how often each process was run in the past 3 days, and then calcualtes the most commonly run processes. For more information, see <https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/LogAnalyticsExamples/blob/master/log-analytics/top-5-running-processes-in-the-last-3-days.md>.

### Task 2: Preventive maintenance using Security Center

In this section, we will use the Security Center Overview screen to review what preventative steps we can take to protect our environment.

1. Within **Security Center** **Overview** page, there are five tiles in the middle of the screen under **Resource security hygiene**.

    ![On the Security Center Overview page, under Prevention, four tiles display: Recommendations, Compute & Apps, Networking, Data & storage, and Identity & access.](images/Lab-guide/image155.png "Security Center Overview page Resource security hygiene tiles")

2. Click on the **Compute** tile to drill into the security health of your compute resources.

    ![Screenshot of the Compute & apps tile.](images/Lab-guide/image156.png "Compute & apps tile")

3. Notice there are several recommendations at the bottom of the screen. Let's go ahead and drill into these recommendations. Click on the **Missing disk encryption** item.

    ![Screenshot of the Compute page, Overview tab information.](images/Lab-guide/image157.png "Compute page, Overview tab")

4. This brings up the Apply disk encryption blade. This gives a description of Azure Disk Encryption, links to instructions, and a list of virtual machines affected.

    ![On the Apply disk encryption blade, a description is given and the virtual machines created in this lab are displayed.](images/Lab-guide/image159.png "Apply disk encryption blade")

5. Close the panel and navigate back to the **Security Center Overview** page. This time, click on the **Networking** tile to drill into the security health of your networking resources.

  ![Screenshot of the Networking tile.](images/Lab-guide/image160.png "Networking tile")

6. Review the items showing in the **Networking Recommendations**. We won't implement these recommendations today, but if we wanted to, we could click on the item and implement each recommendation from this panel.

    ![Screenshot of the Security Health Networking page.](images/Lab-guide/image161.png "Security Health Networking page")

7. Close the panel and navigate back to the **Security Center Overview** screen. This time, click on the **Data & storage** tile.

    ![Data & storage tile screenshot.](images/Lab-guide/image162.png "Data & storage tile")

8. Notice this tile is green which is an indication the resources are in a healthy state. Azure Security Center will flag the tile as red if there are critical recommendations that need to be addressed.

9. As a last step, navigate back to the **Security Center Overview** screen and click on the **Identity & access** tile.

    ![Identity & access tile screenshot.](images/Lab-guide/image163.png "Identity & access tile")

10. As you review the Applications Security Health, notice in this example there's a recommendation to assign a second subscription owner.

    ![Under Identity & access, there is a recommendation to assign more than one subscription owner.](images/Lab-guide/image164.png "Identity & access recommendations")

11. Go ahead and close this panel and return to the **Security Center Overview** page.

12. Azure Security Center provides a quick way to see all the recommendations we just saw in a single view. Click on the **Recommendations** tile under the Overview section.

    ![Screenshot of the Recommendations tile.](images/Lab-guide/image165.png "Recommendations tile")

13. This presents the same recommendations you saw by navigating to each resource type in the previous steps. Clicking each of the recommendations will provide you with additional steps you can take to remediate the issue.

    ![The Recommendations page displays a list of recommendations, their resource, state, and severity.](images/Lab-guide/image166.png "Recommendations page")

### Task 3: Set up an Activity Log alert

If one of the virtual machines in the resource group were to be stopped (deallocated), that's a condition you would want to be notified of. In this section, we will set up an activity log alert to detect this condition.

1. Open the **Azure portal** and navigate to Azure Monitor by clicking **All services**, searching for "*monitor*", and selecting **Monitor**.

    ![The previously mentioned selections are made in the Azure Portal.](images/Lab-guide/image66.png "Azure Portal")

2. Select **Alerts** under **SHARED SERVICES**, followed by **New Alert Rule**.

    ![Under Shared services, Alerts and then New Alert Rule are highlighted.](images/Lab-guide/image167.png "New Alert Rule")

3. Under **Define alert condition**, click on **+ Select target**.

    ![+ Select Target is highlighted on the blade defining a new Azure alert.](images/Lab-guide/image167b.png "Select target screenshot")

4. In the 'Select a resource' blade, open the **Filter by resource type** drop-down and select **Virtual machines**. The UI will show each virtual machine in your subscription, grouped into resource groups. Click on the **HOLRG** resource group to select all the virtual machines in that resource group as the target resources monitored by this alert rule. Verify this selection in the 'Selection preview', then click **Done**.

    ![Screenshot showing the 'select a resource' blade, with selections matching the preceeding text.](images/Lab-guide/image167c.png "'Select a resource' screenshot")

5. Under **Define alert condition**, select **+ Add criteria**.

    ![+ Add Criteria is highlighted on the blade defining a new Azure alert.](images/Lab-guide/image167d.png "Add criteria screenshot")

6. In the 'Configure signal logic' blade, open the **Monitor service** drop-down and select **Activity Log - Administrative**. In the search field, enter **deallocate**. Click on **Deallocate Virtual Machine (virtualMachines)**.

    ![Screenshot showing the 'Configure signal logic' blade, with selections matching the preceeding text.](images/Lab-guide/image167e.png "'Configure signal logic' screenshot")

7. If you have recently stopped the virtual machines, you will see a history of those events, otherwise the chart will show 'No data to display'. Leave the settings at their default values, and click **Done**.

    ![Screenshot showing the 'Configure signal logic' blade, showing a chart of past 'Deallocate Virtual Machine' events. At the bottom of the screenshot, the 'Done' button is highlighted.](images/Lab-guide/image167f.png "'Configure signal logic' screenshot")

8. Under **Define alert details**, fill in as follows:
    - Alert rule name: **Alert on VM deallocate**
    - Description: **Raise an alert any time any VM in the HOLRG resource group is stop-deallocated**.
    - Save alert to resource group: **HOLRG**
    - Enable rule upon creation: **Yes**

    ![Screenshot showing the 'Define alert details' settings filled in as described in the preceeding text.](images/Lab-guide/image167g.png "'Define alert details' screenshot")

9. Under **Define action group**, select **+ New action group**.

    ![+ New action group is highlighted on the blade defining a new Azure alert.](images/Lab-guide/image167h.png "New action group screenshot")

    >**Note**: Action groups define what action is taken when an alert is fired. They are defined separately from the alert rule, so that the same action group can be re-used across multiple alerts.

10. Fill in the first section of the **Add action group** blade as follows:
    - Action group name: **Mobile app push notifications action group**
    - Short name: **Mobile Push**
    - Subscription: **Choose your subscription**.
    - Resource group: **HOLRG**

   ![Screenshot showing the first section of the 'Add action group' blade filled in as described in the preceeding text.](images/Lab-guide/image167i.png "Add action group screenshot")

11. In the table under **Actions**, under **Action name** enter **Notify mobile app**. Open the drop down under **Action Type** and select **Email/SMS/Push/Voice**.

   ![Screenshot showing the first line of the 'Actions' table, filled in as described in the preceeding text.](images/Lab-guide/image167j.png "Actions table screenshot")

12. The **Email/SMS/Push/Voice** blade should open automatically (if it does not, click on **Edit details**). Enable the checkbox for **Azure app Push Notifications**, and fill in your Azure user ID, then select **OK**.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Email/SMS/Push/Voice' blade, filled in as described in the preceeding text.](images/Lab-guide/image167k.png "'Email/SMS/Push/Voice' blade screenshot")

13. All alert settings are now complete. Select **OK** to close the 'Add action group' blade, then click on **Create alert rule** to close the **Create rule** blade. You will see a notification once the alert has been created.

    ![Screenshots of the notification of the successfully created alert rule.](images/Lab-guide/image171.png "Successfully created alert rule message")

    >**Note:** It may take up to 5 minutes after the alert rule is created for the alert to become active.

### Task 4: Installing & using the Azure mobile application

In this section, you will take your monitoring solution mobile by installing and configuring the OMS Mobile Application.

1. Open the **AppStore** or **Google Play** on your mobile device. Locate the search box and type **Microsoft Azure,** and press enter.

2. When you locate the Microsoft Azure application, install it to your device.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft Azure Application Open screen that displays after successfully downloading the application.](images/Lab-guide/image172.png "Azure Application Open screen")

3. Once the application has been installed, you will need to allow the application to send you notifications.

4. Next, touch the Sign In Button.

    ![Screenshot of the Sign in screen.](images/Lab-guide/image173.png "Sign in screen")

5. Once the login page loads, enter your Azure Credentials.

6. Once you are logged into the app, navigate to the Notifications menu to see there are currently no notifications.

    ![Notifications screen screenshot.](images/Lab-guide/image174.png "Notifications screen")

7. Putting the phone aside for a moment, in your desktop web browser, navigate to the **Virtual Machines** list in the Azure portal.

8. Click on **checkbox next to WEBVM1**, then click **Stop**, followed by **Yes** at the confirmation prompt. This will stop (deallocate) this virtual machine, which should trigger our alert to notifiy the Azure mobile application.

    ![WEBVM1 is selected from the virtual machies list, and the 'stop' button is highlighted.](images/Lab-guide/image175.png "Stop WEBVM1")

9. In a few moments, you should receive an alert through the Azure mobile app that the virtual machine was stopped (deallocated).

### Task 5: Application Insights

Understanding what is happening within an application can be very challenging, but with the Application Insights configured for CloudShop, there is great telemetry being fed to the Azure Portal. Here, you will investigate that data regarding how the CloudShop is performing.

1. Open the **Azure portal** and navigate to Azure Monitor by clicking on **All services**, searching for "*monitor*", and selecting **Monitor**.

    ![The previously mentioned selections are made in the Azure portal.](images/Lab-guide/image66.png "Azure portal")

2. Click on the **Application Insights** tile, then select **HOLCloudShop**.

    ![Application Insights (1) is selected in the Overview blade, and under Name, HOLCloudShop (2) is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image177.png "Selecting Application Insights from Azure Monitor")

3. From the Application Insights blade, click on **Pin to Dashboard**.

    ![The Pin to dashboard icon is selected from the Overview blade.](images/Lab-guide/image178.png "Pin to dashboard icon")

4. Under the **INVESTIGATE** section, click the **Performance** item.

    ![Under Investigate, Performance (preview) is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image179.png "Investigate section")

5. The **Performance** feature of Application Insights allows us to get rich performance monitoring and easy to consume dashboards.

6. This dashboard gives near real-time insight into the performance of your application. In the screenshot below, you can see this application appears to have a performance issue with the Home/Index page. It appears to be taking 20.5 seconds on average to load. 

    >**Note**: Your numbers may not match. By clicking on the GET Home/Index, you will see the other sections of the dashboard will filter to performance data focused on that page.

    ![Under Operation Name, Get Home / Index is selected.](images/Lab-guide/image181.png "Operation Name section")

7. Feel free to experiment with this dashboard to understand the performance considerations of your application.

8. Pin the 'Operation times' chart to to My Dashboard by clicking on the pin in the top right of the chart.

    ![Screenshot of the Pin icon.](images/Lab-guide/image183.png "Pin icon")

9. At this point, navigate back to **My Dashboard** and click **Edit Dashboard,** and arrange the many tiles you have added to give yourself an all up view of the environment you have built. Feel free to open the various solutions, find interesting data and Pin it to the Dashboard.

    ![Screenshot of My deashboard.](images/Lab-guide/image184.png "My deashboard")

### Summary

In this exercise, you explored the information and data being provided by Azure Security and Operations Management and Application Insights to gain situational awareness of the application and infrastructure. You looked at the Security Posture of the infrastructure, the performance of applications, and you built a dashboard that can be used to manage it moving forward.
